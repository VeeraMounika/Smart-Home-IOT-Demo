# Smart-Home-IOT-Demo
Lightweight encryption demo for smart home IoT devices.

## Description
This Python script demonstrates lightweight encryption for smart home IoT devices using Fernet symmetric encryption. Simulated sensor and actuator data are encrypted and decrypted to validate secure, low-latency communication.

## Features
- Simulates temperature sensors and smart door locks.
- Encrypts and decrypts device data using Fernet (AES-128).
- Measures and prints encryption and decryption times.
- Suitable for resource-constrained smart home devices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (`pip install cryptography`)
